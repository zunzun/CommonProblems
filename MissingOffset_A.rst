==========================
Equation Missing An Offset
==========================

This illustrates the effect of fitting data with
an offset to an equation that does not have one.

This problem can be caused by experimental
equipmentintroducing bias (such as a DC offset)
during data acquisition. Fitting the data to an
equation with an offset will reveal the bias.
